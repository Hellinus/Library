## Reading analysis and note taking
Reading(3min):
1. Record the **main idea** of intro and each point.
2. Establish a coherent **summary** on each point.
3. Skim through the **details** in each point.

## Listening analysis and note taking
1. Have an **expectation** for the main idea of each point in listening based on points in reading.
2. Capture the **main idea** - hold your expectation before the main idea is stated, and don't be distracted by details.
3. Capture as many **details** as you can.

## Writing Structure
In the reading material, the author cites three reasons to support his/her viewpoint that *(summary of reading intro)*. Nevertheless, the lecturer in the listening material argues that *(summary of listening material)*, and opposes the points in the reading material.

First and foremost, the author argues that *(reading point 1 + main idea)*. However, the lecturer offers an opposite stand that *(listening point 1 + details)*.

In addition, the lecturer casts doubt on the author's another reason that *(reading point 2 + main idea)*, demonstrating that *(listening point 2 + details)*.

Finally, the author's third reason that *(reading point 3 + main idea)* is also counteracted by the lecturer who points out that *(listening point 3 + details)*.

## Rules of thumb
1. \>= 250 words
2. reading / listening preferably between 1/1.5 and 1/2.
3. Organize a clear flow of idea before showing off language skills.

# #029 An Architectural Approach to Level Design - Chapter 1 - A Brief History of Architecture and Level Design
[TOC]

By truly understanding humanityâ€™s built past, we can learn more exactly **how space affects interactivity.**

## BREAKING THE RULES OF LEVEL DESIGN
At the time of this writing, level design is undergoing an identity crisis that game design has been undergoing for several decades. Level design in game design **lacks a universally applicable methodology,** and success depends on considering a variety of factors, including theory, playability, and technology, in a game-specific context.

In order to advance the field of level design, it's important to break traditional rules and think more broadly. While it can be valuable to explore level design for specific game genres, there's also room for generalization.

Architectural history provides valuable insights for level designers, offering practical theories and principles related to spatial design that can be applied to create engaging and emotionally resonant game spaces.

## AN EXPERIENTIAL HISTORY OF ARCHITECTURE
The history of architecture can be understood through various lenses or perspectives. These perspectives include:
- **Structural Components:** Some scholars focus on the history of architectural elements like post-and-lintel construction, columns, arches, domes, and vaults.
- **Evolution of Styles:** Others concentrate on how architectural styles have evolved over time, often emphasizing the formal and sculptural aspects of buildings.
- **Architectural Experiences:** A third perspective considers the evolution of architectural experiences, which can be influenced by cultural factors and reflect the intentions of the designers and builders. Experientially focused buildings use spatial design to create specific experiences or convey broader ideas.

An understanding of various aspects of architectural history can be beneficial for game and level designers. Specifically:
1. **Structural Believability:** If in-game structures don't appear structurally sound, it can break player engagement.
2. **Art Direction:** Understanding architectural styles and forms is crucial for art directors in shaping the visual aesthetics of games.
3. **Theming and Immersion:** Architectural allusions and design choices can help theme game spaces and immerse players in the game world.
4. **Language of Communication:** Style and form are essential aspects of how games communicate with players, and they play a significant role in conveying the game's narrative, atmosphere, and themes.

This book primarily emphasizes the experiential aspects of architecture in the context of level design. 

### Elements of Architecture and Level Design
The Roman architect Vitruvius, who lived around 40 BCE, considered *firmitas* (firmness), *utilitias* (utility), and *venustas* (delight) to be the vital elements of architecture. This book, based on spatial design theory while addressing practical elements of level construction, utilizes elements similar to those outlined by Vitruvius.

#### Functional Requirements
**First and foremost, your game must work.** This is the firmitas of level design. It is for this reason that this book will keep theory discussions grounded in level construction methods. Chapter 3, for example, discusses practical elements of level design, including overviews of level construction methods for several engines. Later chapters discuss theory with an eye toward how game assets may be used to fulfill experiential goals for level design.

#### Usability
**Next, gamespaces must be usable.** In this way, we should concentrate on how players see gamespace through points of view, game cameras, and how they navigate levels. This element of level design concentrates on **navigation and teaching.** As we will see, levels are an opportunity for game designers to have an indirect conversation with players. As such, our game levels should teach players how to use themselves and speak in easily understood language.

#### Delight
Lastly, our gamespaces should be rewarding to go through. For this, we must engage the **psychological elements of level design** and understand **how levels guide players through emotional experiences.** By challenging and rewarding players, we offer them opportunities to have agency over the climactic elements of games in ways no other media form can offer. For this, we should strive to create the most engaging experience possible.

### The Beginnings of Architectural Sight Lines
The evolution of architecture reflects human history and societal changes.

Several key points:
1. **Functionality and Shelter:** Architecture initially served the primary purpose of providing shelter, with early human dwellings ranging from caves to temporary structures made of animal skins and poles, suitable for a migratory lifestyle.
2. **Transition to Settlements:** As humans shifted to settled agricultural lifestyles around 12,000 years ago, their dwellings became more permanent and hut-like.
3. **Rise of Cities:** With the growth of settlements into cities, new societal roles emerged, including priests and other important figures responsible for spiritual matters.
4. **Spiritual Architecture:** The development of spiritual aspects of life led to the construction of buildings for worship and burial. These architectural designs were influenced by sacred elements and astronomical considerations.

**Designed Sight Lines:** Examples like Newgrange in Ireland and Stonehenge in England illustrate how early architectural elements were carefully planned to align with astronomical phenomena. This shows that even in ancient architecture, designers used forms to direct the attention of occupants and create specific experiences.

Understanding how architectural forms influenced human behavior and interaction can be valuable for level designers in shaping player experiences within game environments.

### Architecture as Representation in Ancient Mesopotamia
Ancient civilizations, like the Sumerians, used architectural forms and designs to convey symbolic and representational meanings, such as connecting with gods or demonstrating power.

*Ziggurat,* a temple raised on an artificial mound, often built of kiln-fired brick. The development of the *ziggurat* is important in the development of architecture as a system of representation. The *ziggurat* form is said to have fulfilled two functions:
1. elevating temples closer to the gods;
2. recalling the mountains from which the Sumerians migrated.

In this way, the Sumerians were usingshapes or ornamentation of buildings to convey a larger idea.

The representational systemsutilized by Mesopotamian cultures will be useful as we study how to build game worlds and use art and sound assets to set environmental tone.

### Architecture as Statement in Ancient Egypt
Ancient Egyptian monumental architecture served to establish connections between pharaohs and gods, with a focus on the sun god Ra. Pyramids and temples were designed to symbolize these connections. Egyptian architecture evolved from pyramids to temple forms with sequential spaces, and their use of columns influenced later Greek styles.

This architecture standardized forms and associated cultural ideas with them, contributing to a modular architectural language.

# #030 An Architectural Approach to Level Design - Chapter 2 - Drawing for Level Designers
[TOC]
The working definition of level design: "the thoughtful execution of gameplay into gamespace for players to dwell in."

In this chapter, we discuss what game levels do to create user experiences. We will then discuss different tools used for level design both on and off the computer. With the tools in this chapter, you can analyze historical precedents the way architects do to inform their own designs and implement your ideas in your own gamespaces.

## LEVEL DESIGN GOALS
There is something exciting about the act of creating. This is what many people who aspire to be architects and game designers are ultimately looking for—fulfillment in the act of creation.

Great or even simply good levels should be planned—not only to get an image of what the level will look like, but also to understand the kind of experience the designer hopes to create for players. Therefore, before exploring the different digital tools for level design, it is important to know that **game levels are the primary tool of communication between game makers and game players.**

If game levels are executions of *gameplay*—the system of rules that create a user experience—then levels are also the medium that game designers use to express this gameplay to players.

As the primary tool for communication between game designers and game players, game levels should be built with three goals in mind. By reaching these goals, designers can better direct players through games and create meaningful user experiences:
1. Adjusting player behavior
2. Transmitting meaning
3. Augmenting space

### Adjusting Player Behavior
Many designers argue that a level’s primary function is to teach players how to play a game - Repetition of *Skill gate* situations could reinforces gameplay lessons.

> *Skill gates* are required challenges that block a player’s progress unless he or she performs a specific action to pass. Such obstacles can be very simple, such as an enemy or object that players must jump over, or more complex, such as games that require you to use new abilities to escape from the room where you acquire them.

While behavior adjustment can be accomplished in very planned ways, another way to adjust behavior is to build your levels to **support or encourage unplanned play.** If a game allows players the choice of many things to do, especially in massively
multiplayer online games, players will find inventive ways to make levels fit their play style.

### Transmitting Meaning
Embedding meaning in structural systems is a hallmark of architectural design. Much of architectural history is focused around sacred structures.

In games, narrative descriptors contained within a game’s dialog, art, and symbolism interact with formal and structural elements of game levels—rules of movement and level geometry. Understanding how these work together helps create meaningful game levels. Rather than simply turning to cutscenes for storytelling, designers can make their game levels do a lot of narrative legwork for them.

### Augmentation of Space
In some games, levels can give information to players in ways that allow them to make informed decisions about what is coming next. Patterns in level design can inform players when bosses or other significant enemies are coming.

Patterned spaces can be powerful ways to communicate with players. In architecture, formal *symbols* are often used to communicate the function of a building.

Establishing a set of formal or spatial symbols allows players to understand what’s next in a level, or even what objects are interactive. Through this type of formal interaction, gamespaces build their own “languages” that can assist in directing player behavior or communicating meaning and narrative.
